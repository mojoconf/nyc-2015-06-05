Hello [name],

We regret to inform you that your abstract was not accepted for
Mojoconf 2015.

There could have been many reasons for this decision, and none of them
is about the individual person.  Usually, the talk could not be fit
into a slot, there were too many similar topics, or the abstract
itself was not specific enough.

In lieu of this decision, we are happy to provide you with a 15%
discount for the conference.  When booking your ticket, please use
this coupon code:

Also, if we by chance have a slot open up, we will reconsider all
abstracts that were not initially accepted.

We look forward to seeing you at Mojoconf 2015!

The Mojoconf Team
