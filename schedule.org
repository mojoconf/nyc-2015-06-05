** June 6th :: Hackathon Day

Saturdays were born to be hacking days!  This hackathon focuses on
WebDev and WebOps with Mojolicious.  There will be three breakouts --
one of which hasn't been announced yet!

Like training and conference day, snacks and food will be provided!
Make sure to thank our Hackathon sponsor during your breaks from the
keyboard.

_Breakout One_: Mojo Plugin Madness!

In this Hackathon breakout, a couple of the Mojolicious Core Team will
be driving a run-though of all the Plugin bugs and facilitating fixes
and modernization for them.  The hacker with the largest number of
accepted pull requests gets a prize!

_Breakout Two_: MCT Payments a Plenty!

MCT, the Mojolicious Conference Toolkit, comes with one payment system
capability built in.  We will work our way through adding three more!
Learn all about online payments and how to integrate payment providers
in a highly responsive way.

_Breakout Three_:  TBA
