Please add the date / time you intend to arrive at NYC and depart from NYC.

Most of you will arrive day of training, ideally by 3pm.

Take into consideration going to YAPC::NA.  If you are based in the US, you will be
routed back to origin at end of conference.  For those of you from europe, feel free 
to give a date of return routing back through NYC.  You will be responsible for
booking travel between NYC and SLC.
